\# Smart Attendance Automation Platform â€” RFID and Facial Recognition



The Smart Attendance Automation Platform is a comprehensive solution for real-time, automated attendance management using \*\*facial recognition\*\* and \*\*RFID technology\*\*. It is built with \*\*Python (OpenCV, NumPy)\*\* for AI-driven facial detection, along with \*\*PHP and MySQL\*\* for a secure and scalable backend.



The system captures live video streams and RFID inputs, processing them to generate accurate attendance records instantly. Its \*\*API-driven architecture\*\* ensures seamless integration with enterprise systems and real-time data synchronization across multiple endpoints.



\## Key Features

\- Dual verification with facial recognition and RFID

\- Secure backend with structured PHP/MySQL database

\- Real-time attendance logging and analytics

\- Modular, scalable architecture suitable for enterprises



\## Installation \& Setup
